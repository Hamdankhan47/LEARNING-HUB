    Difference Between HTML, XHTML, and HTML5

        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. It has a loose syntax and is forgiving of errors. It doesn’t require all tags to be closed and is not case-sensitive.

        XHTML (Extensible HTML) is a stricter version of HTML based on XML. It requires all tags to be properly closed, lowercase, and well-formed. It is more rigid and less forgiving.

        HTML5 is the latest version of HTML. It combines the flexibility of HTML with new features like multimedia support, semantic elements, and APIs for building modern web apps. It is the most commonly used version today.

        ✅ HTML5 is the current standard for building modern websites.

    Absolute vs Relative URLs

    A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address of a resource on the web.

        An Absolute URL gives the full path to the resource, including the protocol (http/https), domain, and file path.
        Example: https://www.example.com/images/logo.png

        A Relative URL gives the path relative to the current page or directory.
        Example: images/logo.png

        Key Points:

        Use absolute URLs when linking to external websites.

        Use relative URLs when linking within your own website or project.

        ✅ Relative URLs make your code portable and flexible.

    Semantic vs Non-Semantic Elements

        Semantic elements clearly describe their purpose or meaning in the HTML structure.
            Examples: <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <nav>

        Non-semantic elements do not give any information about their content. They are used only for layout and styling.
            Examples: <div>, <span>

        Why semantics matter:

            Improve accessibility for screen readers

            Better SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

            Make the code more readable and maintainable

        ✅ Use semantic tags for cleaner, meaningful HTML structure.

    Block vs Inline Elements
        Block-level elements:

            Always start on a new line

            Take up the full width available

            Can contain other block or inline elements
                Examples: <div>, <p>, <h1>, <section>

        Inline elements:

            Do not start on a new line

            Take only as much width as necessary

            Can only contain text or other inline elements
                Examples: <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>

        Usage Tip:
        Use block elements to create the structure or layout of a page, and inline elements to format text within those blocks.

        ✅ Understanding block vs inline is key for layout and styling in CSS.

    HTML Versions – HTML4 vs HTML5
        HTML4 was the previous standard, released in 1997. It lacked support for multimedia and required external plugins (like Flash) for audio and video. It also used long and complex doctype declarations.

        HTML5, introduced in 2014, is the latest standard. It supports:

            Built-in <audio> and <video> elements

            Modern form controls (like <date>, <range>)

            Semantic elements (like <article>, <nav>, <footer>)

            APIs for web storage, geolocation, canvas drawing, etc.

            A simple doctype: <!DOCTYPE html>

        HTML5 Advantages:

            Mobile-friendly

            Rich multimedia support

            Cleaner code structure

            No need for extra plugins

        ✅ HTML5 is recommended for all modern websites and web applications.
